# QMaster

**QMaster** is a web-based platform designed to automate the generation of educational questions (multiple-choice and descriptive) from user-uploaded content, such as PDFs, while providing seamless user management features. It supports educators, students, and institutions by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to create high-quality, contextually relevant questions.

QMaster consists of a robust backend built with **Flask** and a modern frontend developed using **Vite** and **React**, working together to streamline content processing, question generation, and user interactions ‚Äî enhancing the overall learning experience.
